# Marahel
Marahel (ProcEngine 2.0) is a step toward having a unified opensource library for different map generation techniques.

This framework uses Prando (https://www.npmjs.com/package/prando) for random number generation and Noise! (https://github.com/josephg/noisejs) for 2D perlin noise generation.
